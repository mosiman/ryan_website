## To Do

- Sliding transitions
    > Careful attention to tall images (like in aboutme), how can I get to slide at same rate?
- Text on AboutMepage
- Components for more pictures page
- Responsive layouts and CSS Grid
    > Look out for AboutMe page text, should go from side (normal) to bottom (small viewport)
    * [ ] Learn CSS Grid
    * [ ] Design logo for small viewports (instead of ryan chan)
